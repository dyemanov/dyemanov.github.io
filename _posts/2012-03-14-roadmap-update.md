title: Firebird roadmap has been updated
---

The project [roadmap](http://www.firebirdsql.org/en/roadmap/) has been updated a bit. The change is to boost the v2.1.5 and v2.5.2 releases at the cost of slightly delaying the v3.0 Alpha release.

Firebird 2.1.4 was released exactly one year ago, so now it's a promised time for v2.1.5. It has 53 bugs fixed and no critical issues remaining unresolved. Firebird 2.5.1 was released more than 5 months ago and the expected release date for v2.5.2 is approaching the next month. It has 45 issues resolved up-to-date and a few more are in the pipeline. So it makes a lot of sense to release them sooner rather than later.

The v3.0 Alpha release will be going through the preparation stage while all three release candidates (v2.0.7, v2.1.5, v2.5.2) are being field tested, so it's likely to appear shortly after the aforementioned releases, in the second quarter.

Thanks for your understanding.
